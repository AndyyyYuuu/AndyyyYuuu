[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,pytorch,html,js,css,java,processing,swift,bash)](https://skillicons.dev)  
Ever since my parents signed me up for a Python course in 2020, I've explored its libraries, taught myself the web languages, and started a [<span>game dev team</span>](blue-square.itch.io). My most recent shenanigans involve machine learning with PyTorch.

## :canoe: My Journey
**2018** - Got a bit of exposure to **C++** during my time in Beijing.  
**2020** - Parents signed me up for an online **Python** course.  
**2021** - Built console-based games in **Python**. Explored Python graphics libraries.  
**2022** - Made apps with **SwiftUI**. Taught myself **HTML** and **JavaScript**. Co-founded [BlueSquareDuo](blue-square.itch.io) building games on itch.io.  
**2023** - Developed more games with **JavaScript**. Transitioned to **PyTorch** machine learning.  
**2024** - Still working on machine learning; we'll see what's next.  -->

## :classical_building: Projects
**Neural Network From Scratch** ([link](https://github.com/AndyyyYuuu/nn-from-scratch))  
&emsp;&emsp;An autograd engine from scratch, no PyTorch, no Numpy, just vanilla Python.

**BlueSquareDuo** ([link](blue-square.itch.io))  
&emsp;&emsp;A game dev team in collaboration with [@realBarry123](https://github.com/realBarry123).  
&emsp;&emsp;We have 5 games, with one more, [Space Frog Invasion](https://github.com/AndyyyYuuu/space-frog-invasion), coming soon!
